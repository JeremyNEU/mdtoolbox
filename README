MD Toolbox
==========

MD Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for analysis of molecular dynamics
trajectories of biomolecules. It consists of a collection of MATLAB
functions which cover the following types of scientific computations:

* I/O for topology, coordinates, and trajectory files used for MD simulation
* Least-squares fitting of structures
* Anisotropic network model (Elastic network model)
* Calculation of PMF surface from scattered data
* Principal component analysis
* Hydrogen bond analysis
* WHAM, and MBAR methods
* Other auxiliary functions... such as atom selections
