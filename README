MDToolbox
=========

MDToolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for statistical analysis of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation data of biomolecules. It consists of a
collection of MATLAB functions covering the following types of
scientific computations: 

* I/O for topology, coordinates, and trajectory files used for MD simulation
* Least-squares fitting of structures
* Calculation of potential mean force (PMF) from scattered data
* Statistical estimators (WHAM and MBAR methods)
* Dimensional reductions (Principal Component Analysis, and others)
* Elastic network models (Gaussian and Anisotropic network models)
* Utility functions, such as atom selections

For more information, see the documentation http://mdtoolbox.readthedocs.org/
