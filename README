MDToolbox
=========
MDToolbox is a MATLAB/Octave toolbox for statistical analysis of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of biomolecules. It consists
of a collection of functions covering the following types of
scientific computations: 

* I/O for trajectory, coordinate, and topology files used for MD simulation
* Least-squares fitting of structures
* Potential mean force (PMF) or free energy profile from scattered data
* Statistical estimates (WHAM and MBAR methods) from biased data
* Dimensional reductions (Principal Component Analysis, and others)
* Elastic network models (Gaussian and Anisotropic network models)
* Unsupervised learning for refining Markov State Models (Baum-Welch algorithm and others)
* Utility functions, such as atom selections

For more information, see the documentation http://mdtoolbox.readthedocs.org/
